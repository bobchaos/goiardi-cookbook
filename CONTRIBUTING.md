# Contributing

## Code

Got a cool feature, or a performance improvement, or better tests maybe? Do
this:

- Fork it
- create a feature branch
  - the name should either reference a github issue or your feature
- commit your work to it
  - Many short commits > a big commit. If sqashing is in order we'll ask during
    PR review or do it when merging.
- Add new tests as required
- cookstyle
- Ensure all kitchen tests, new and existing, pass.
- Open a pull request against this repository

During review we may ask you to rebase or modify some things.

## Issues

Writing code isn't the only way to help. Reporting bugs and other issues is
critical to improving OSS.

- Search this repo on gitlab for existing issues. You can +1 the original post,
  or provide additional information if you have anything relevant. If no issue
is found...
- Detail a clear reproduction case
- Get logs and/or debug/trace output of the run
  - Sanitize it! Don't post your production conf on the internet o.O
- Open an issue against this repo and add the information collected there

## Have fun coding!
